                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    A roguelike game about being a student. Gameplay involved strategically dragging blocks to decide what actions to do for the day based on upcoming tasks.
                    Different blocks have different effects and you have to manage certain stats to progress.
                    There are also random text events where you must make choices based on your stats. This was my first real attempt at building and actually completing a game.

                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to beginning this project I had minimal experience with C# and Unity. The little knowledge I had was from experimenting and constant googling.
