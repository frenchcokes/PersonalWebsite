                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    An application which extracts message data and other facts from Discord Data Packages. I got this idea after wondering what my Discord stats were and made this program to find them for me. 
                </p>

                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing I needed to do was to actually understand the format of these data packages. Unsurprisingly, the messages data is stored in a file called messages.csv.
                    using the Pandas read_csv function, I could get a dataframe of the content fairly easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This file then had to be cleaned, with the messages types being translated into what they actually were (Private DMs, Servers, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the data ready to go, I started graphing with Pyplot. I experimented with putting the graphs on seperate pngs, but it seemed better to have them all in one image.
                    I also thought it would be cool to have some facts, so I added in calculations for those as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the calculations and graphs working correctly, I built the user interface with Tkinter. I wasn't very experienced with this library so the UI wasn't great. However, 
                    it could do the tasks of displaying the calculated facts and accepting a file path, so it served it's purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the application was complete and after a little research, I used PyInstaller to turn the code into an application.
                </p>
