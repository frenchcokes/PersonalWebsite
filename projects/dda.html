                    An application which extracts message data and other facts from Discord Data Packages. I got this idea after wondering what my Discord stats were and made this program to find them for me.

                    The first thing I needed to do was to actually understand the format of these data packages. Unsurprisingly, the messages data is stored in a file called messages.csv.
                    using the Pandas read_csv function, I could get a dataframe of the content fairly easy. The message.csv files were stored in seperate folders so a loop had to be done to
                    go through each file path to get the complete info.
